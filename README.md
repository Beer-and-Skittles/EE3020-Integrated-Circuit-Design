# EE3020 Integrated Circuit Design
Final Grade: **A-**\
Taken @: 2022 Fall

## Course Description
 Integrated circuits put complicated circuitry on a miniature-scale die. They form an essential component in popular computer, communications, and layout design of digital integrated circuits. Homeworks are focused on hands-on design tool experience, which complement the textbook class notes.

 ## HW1: /kendall
 * A gate-level combinational circuit that finds Kendall coefficient of four pairs of given numbers.
 * The Kendall coefficient $\tau$ is defined as:

 $\tau = \frac{(\mathnormal{number of concordant pairs}) - (\mathnormal{number of discordant pairs})}{\mathnormal{number of pairs}} = 1 - \frac{2(\mathnormal(number of discordant pairs))}{\binom{n}{2}}$

 ## HW2: /factorization
 * A prime factorization circuit that computes the powers of the prime factors 2, 3, 5 of target number.
 * Recursively designed.
